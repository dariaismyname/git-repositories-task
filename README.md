In order to run the project on your device you first need to copy the repository, run it with the IDE and install the dependency packages with the commands:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## User features

1) As a user, I would like to see the top contributors in a grid card layout sorted by the number of commits. (completed)
2) I would like to see the next page of the contributors by simply scrolling down, and I expect a smooth user experience and a Loading title.
3) For each card, I would like to see the avatar, user name, number of commits, a compass icon (button) and an indicator presenting that the list item is selectable.
4) By tapping the compass icon, I would like to see a map to show the user’s public location (if such info is available). (completed 50/50)
5) By tapping on the “View Repository” button in a card, I would like to see a scrollable-paginated list of the repositories of the selected contributor sorted by the updated date (most up-to-date is on the top). (completed)
